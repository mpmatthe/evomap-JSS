# evomap-package

Replication Code for the paper: 'evomap - a Toolbox for Dynamic Mapping in Python'.

First, install the evomap package:
```
conda env create -n evomap-package python
conda activate evomap-package
pip install evomap
```

**Note**: Python 3.13 has just been released and may not yet be compatible with some of evomap's dependencies. We recommend using Python 3.12 or earlier.

Then, run the replication code:
```
python src/evomap-demo.py
```
Last updated/tested: Oct 14 2024 using MacOS 13.5.2, Python 3.12.0, and evomap version 0.4.4
